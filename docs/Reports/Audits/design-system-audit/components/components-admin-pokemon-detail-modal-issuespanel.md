## 17. Figma reconstruction specification

- Auto Layout: Estimated from implementation. Preserve every nested flex/grid boundary shown in the HTML outline.
- Component set: create one variant axis per explicit prop/value pair listed above; do not invent missing variants.
- Boolean properties: Warning, Success, Empty, Scrollable.
- Instance swaps: Not found.
- Text properties: expose each textual prop from the props contract; when text is hardcoded, preserve it in the default instance.
- Variables: bind CSS variables and semantic token references listed in this document. Literal utilities remain documented implementation values.
- Constraints: infer from width/min/max and responsive utilities; any value not encoded is marked Estimated from implementation.
- Nested components: use the child component links below as true instances rather than detached groups.
- Interactive components: create prototype states only for interactions detected in the state/event tables.
