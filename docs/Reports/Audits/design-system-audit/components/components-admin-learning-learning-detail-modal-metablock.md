## 4. HTML structure

The following outline preserves every JSX element occurrence detected inside this component definition. Conditional branches can therefore appear as sibling paths.

- <div>
  - <span>
  - <p>

Unique HTML/React tags: `div`, `p`, `span`.

## 5. React structure and state management

- Hooks: Not found.
- Local state initializers: Not found.
- Event handlers exposed in JSX: Not found.

## 6. Props and defaults

| Prop/binding | Default | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| label | Not found | See exact signature/contract below |
| value | Not found | See exact signature/contract below |

Exact parameter signature:

```tsx
{ label, value }: { label: string; value: string }
```

Exact local props contract when statically resolvable:

```tsx
{ label: string; value: string }
```

## 7. Variants and component properties

| Property | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Not found | Not found | No explicit variant union detected |

- Focus behavior: Not found.
- Pointer/cursor behavior: Not found.
- Expand/collapse behavior: Not found.

## 10. Layout, spacing, sizing and constraints

- Explicit layout behavior beyond the JSX structure: Not found.

| Token family | Exact implementation references |
|---|---|
| CSS variables | Not found |
| Literal colors | Not found |
| Spacing | `mt-1`, `mt-3` |
| Sizing | Not found |

| Radius | Not found |
| Borders/strokes | Not found |

- Auto Layout equivalent: Estimated from implementation from flex/grid direction, alignment, gap and padding utilities.

## 11. Every Tailwind utility / CSS class token

| Token | Variant/pseudo prefix | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| `font-black` | base | static occurrence |
| `font-semibold` | base | static occurrence |
| `leading-6` | base | static occurrence |
| `mt-1` | base | static occurrence |
| `mt-3` | base | static occurrence |
| `text-brand-2` | base | static occurrence |
| `text-muted` | base | static occurrence |
| `text-sm` | base | static occurrence |
| `text-xs` | base | static occurrence |
| `tracking-[0.13em]` | base | static occurrence |
| `uppercase` | base | static occurrence |

Exact className combinations:

- `mt-1 text-sm font-semibold leading-6 text-muted`

## 16. Icons, images and decorative assets

- Lucide icons: Not found.
- Asset references: Not found.
- SVG usage: Not found.
- Decorative/semantic intent for empty alt text must follow the exact source; intent beyond attributes: Estimated from implementation.

## 17. Figma reconstruction specification

- Auto Layout: Estimated from implementation. Preserve every nested flex/grid boundary shown in the HTML outline.
- Component set: create one variant axis per explicit prop/value pair listed above; do not invent missing variants.
- Boolean properties: Not found.
- Instance swaps: Not found.
- Text properties: expose each textual prop from the props contract; when text is hardcoded, preserve it in the default instance.
- Variables: bind CSS variables and semantic token references listed in this document. Literal utilities remain documented implementation values.
- Constraints: infer from width/min/max and responsive utilities; any value not encoded is marked Estimated from implementation.
- Nested components: use the child component links below as true instances rather than detached groups.
- Interactive components: create prototype states only for interactions detected in the state/event tables.
