## 15. Accessibility, ARIA and keyboard support

- Roles: Not found.
- Keyboard events: Not found.
- Focus management hooks/refs: Not found.
- Native semantics derive from the exact tag outline; compliance level without runtime inspection: Not found.

## 16. Icons, images and decorative assets

- Lucide icons: Not found.
- Asset references: Not found.
- SVG usage: Not found.
- Decorative/semantic intent for empty alt text must follow the exact source; intent beyond attributes: Estimated from implementation.

## 17. Figma reconstruction specification

- Auto Layout: grid translated into nested Auto Layout frames. Preserve every nested flex/grid boundary shown in the HTML outline.
- Component set: create one variant axis per explicit prop/value pair listed above; do not invent missing variants.
- Boolean properties: Not found.
- Instance swaps: Not found.
- Text properties: expose each textual prop from the props contract; when text is hardcoded, preserve it in the default instance.
- Variables: bind CSS variables and semantic token references listed in this document. Literal utilities remain documented implementation values.
- Constraints: infer from width/min/max and responsive utilities; any value not encoded is marked Estimated from implementation.
- Nested components: use the child component links below as true instances rather than detached groups.
- Interactive components: create prototype states only for interactions detected in the state/event tables.
