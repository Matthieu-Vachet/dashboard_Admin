## 11. Every Tailwind utility / CSS class token

| Token | Variant/pseudo prefix | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| `bg-slate-950/30` | base | static occurrence |
| `border` | base | static occurrence |
| `border-white/10` | base | static occurrence |
| `font-black` | base | conditional or expression-derived |
| `font-mono` | base | conditional or expression-derived |
| `min-w-0` | base | static occurrence |
| `mt-1` | base | conditional or expression-derived |
| `px-3` | base | static occurrence |
| `py-2.5` | base | static occurrence |
| `rounded-xl` | base | static occurrence |
| `text-[9px]` | base | static occurrence |

## 17. Figma reconstruction specification

- Auto Layout: Estimated from implementation. Preserve every nested flex/grid boundary shown in the HTML outline.
- Component set: create one variant axis per explicit prop/value pair listed above; do not invent missing variants.
- Boolean properties: Not found.
- Instance swaps: Not found.
- Text properties: expose each textual prop from the props contract; when text is hardcoded, preserve it in the default instance.
- Variables: bind CSS variables and semantic token references listed in this document. Literal utilities remain documented implementation values.
- Constraints: infer from width/min/max and responsive utilities; any value not encoded is marked Estimated from implementation.
- Nested components: use the child component links below as true instances rather than detached groups.
- Interactive components: create prototype states only for interactions detected in the state/event tables.
